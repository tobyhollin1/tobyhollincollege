            Our esteemed employees strive to make themselves into harder working while also improving their productivity and web development skills. 
            Shown in the employee banner is some of our strongest emloyees (in terms of website development of course, as a company we would never put our employees in a hunger games scenario).
            Jimmy (1st one on the banner) has been working with use since he was 17, where he was a simply a junior web developer when we first started, now he is a senior manager for all of our junior web developers.
            Another of our employees, Sarah (3rd on the banner) has only been with us for a year and he is the best web developer which we have to this day. Jimmy helped her develop him develop his skills.
            One last look at an employee is Thaolesson who is Romanian (5th on the banner), when he first came to our company we had him complete a trial, where he blew our minds away with how strong of a web developer he is. 
            We are hopefull that you and any other junior web developers will take these storys of success from Jimmy, Jimbo, Sarah, John and Thaolesson to join our company and strive to make yourself the best that you could ever be.
